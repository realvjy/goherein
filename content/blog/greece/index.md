        <p>Greeks love their sweets, which are often based on olive oil and honey combinations encased in flaky filo pastry. The classic baklava involves honey, filo and groundnuts. Or try galaktoboureko, a sinful custard-filled pastry. A more simple sweet is local thyme honey drizzled over fresh, thick Greek yogurt.</p>

        <p>Along harbors, octopuses are hung out to dry like washing – one of the iconic images of Greece. Grilled or marinated, they make a fine meze (appetizer), or main course stewed in wine.</p>

        <p>Greeks are masters of charcoal-grilled and spit-roasted meats. Souvlaki, chunks of skewered pork, is still Greece’s favorite fast food, served on chopped tomatoes and onions in pitta bread with lashings of tzatziki. Gyros, too, is popular served in the same way. At the taverna, local free-range lamb and pork dominate, though kid goat is also a favorite.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Variations on moussaka are found throughout the Mediterranean and the Balkans, but the iconic Greek oven-bake is based on layers of sautéed aubergine, minced lamb, fried puréed tomato, onion, garlic and spices like cinnamon and allspice, a bit of potato, then a final fluffy topping of béchamel sauce and cheese.</p>

        <p>Greeks have been cultivating olives for millennia – some even say that Athena gave an olive tree to the city of Athens, thus winning its favour. Greek meals are accompanied by local olives, some cured in a hearty sea salt brine, others like wrinkly throubes, eaten uncured from the tree. Similarly, olive oil, the elixir of Greece, is used liberally in cooking and salads and drizzled over most dips and dishes. Many tavernas use their own oil.</p>
