In Spain, there are three common types of paella: Paella Valenciana (white rice, vegetables, chicken, duck and rabbit meat, land snails, beans, and spices), Seafood Paella (rice, seafood, and seasoning), and Paella Mixta, which is actually a freestyle mixture usually made of rice, chicken, seafood (including clams), vegetables, olive oil, saffron, and other spices.</p>

      <p>Like most Spanish dishes, gazpacho can be cooked in more than one way. Warm or cold, soup, salad, or even stew, this staple of Andalusian cuisine is generally made from tomatoes, cucumber, onion, garlic, a little olive oil, wine vinegar, and salt.</p>

      <p>Many say that crema catalana and the French crème brûlée are the same things, but there are some tiny differences between the two fabulous desserts. For example, the French always bake their crème brûlée in bain-marie and serve it warm, while the Catalan cream is always served cold and it has a custard infused with lemon rind and cinnamon, instead of vanilla.</p>
