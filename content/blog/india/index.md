      <p>Ever heard of soul-satisfying food? Biryani tops the list. It is a delicious savory rice dish that is loaded with spicy marinated chicken/lamb and colorful saffron rice. Best accompanied with dahi chutney or mirchi ka salan. A slow-cooked, delectable chicken biryani full of aromatic flavours and masala layers, cooked in a Handi which is a round pot like vessel, with the neck narrower than the base, should be on every foodie's list. Slurrrrrp!!</p>
